If the MMV test gives a positive result:      100% of the time for people with the virus      5% of the time for people without the virusAnd the population has a prevalence of 1%,Then if a randomly selected person is tested and tests positive, the chances of them having MMV is 95%If I learned that my friend has tested positive for MMV, I would tell them that there is a 5% chance that the result of the test was a false-positive, and in that case, they do not have MMV. However, the test is 95% accurate and there is therefore a 95% chance that they have MMV.

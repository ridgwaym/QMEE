Assignment 1:

My chosen data set details the impact of anthropogenic noise on immunity in a model host-parasite system (guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli). Anthropogenic noise is a stressor experienced in every habitat, including aquatic systems. Noise pollution can lead to chronic stress in fishes, which can subsequently impact their hearing, behaviour and immunity. A metric used to characterize the immune function of a fish is to test susceptibility to parasitic infections, therefore this study experimentally exposed guppies to chronic or acute noise and observed their parasite resistance. 

The data includes the fish ID, fish length, treatment/noise level the fish were exposed to, parasite count, the maximum parasite count, and the date the fish died. The biological question that I am interested in answering is how does a noise stressor impact the immunity and lifespan of Guppies? 

Assignment 2:

With this data I would like to investigate how stress level impacts the immune response of fishes by examining changes in parasite load over time. I would also like to examine how a potential change in immune response impacts their longevity. In  order to sort my data into replicable components I would like to take the mean parasite load for each sampling day (days 1 - 10) within each treatment and plot each treatment as its own series on a line graph, demonstrating the change in immune response over time during or following a noise stressor to show a time course of the response. 


Assignment 3:

First, I wanted to look at the time course of the parasite count following the exposure to different types of noise stressors. I plotted each treatment individually first with the sampling day on the x axis, since each individual was observed over multiple days, and parasite count as the primary response variable on the y-axis. Since I am looking at how a variable changes over time I chose to display the relationship using a line graph. In addition to looking at each treatment individually, I chose to plot all three treatments together as a line graph in order to show how each treatment compares to each other in terms of their impact on parasite count. For aesthetics, I chose to display each treatment with a different coloured line. Next, I added up the parasite counts for all sampling days to get the total number of parasites that each individual had over the course of the sampling period. I then took the mean of all individuals for each treatment and plotted them on a bar graph. With this plot, I wanted to show the full extent of the parasite load for individuals in each treatment. For aesthetics I chose to use a simple theme so the data stood out and was easy to interpret.

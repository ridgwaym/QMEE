My chosen data set details parasite communities in juvenile Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, and steelhead collected in Ocean Salmon Surveys. This data is part of an ongoing long-term survey of salmon of the west coast. This data is important for making correlations between ocean conditions and the distribution, abundance, and survival of juvenile Colombia River salmon in the Northern California Current nearshore ecosystem. Ocean indicators, such as parasite presense can provide managers from environmental agenies the ability to forcast adult returns in the future. 

The data includes the date of collection, location of collection, the distance offshore, the depth of the station where the data was collected, the species observed, the age class, length and weight of the individual, and finally, parasite species, location, and count. The biological question that I am interested in answering is how do parasite impact the survival and abundance of salmon?

My chosen data set details the impact of anthropogenic noise on immunity in a model host-parasite system (guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli). Anthropogenic noise is a stressor experienced in every habitat, including aquatic systems. Noise pollution can lead to chronic stress in fishes, which can subsequently impact their hearing, behaviour and immunity. A metric used to characterize the immune function of a fish is to test susceptibility to parasitic infections, therefore this study experimentally exposed guppies to chronic or acute noise and observed their parasite resistance. 

The data includes the fish ID, fish length, treatment/noise level the fish were exposed to, parasite count, the maximum parasite count, and the date the fish died. The biological question that I am interested in answering is how does a noise stressor  impact the immunity and lifespan of Guppies?

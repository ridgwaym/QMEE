Hypothesis for my selected data:

I hypothesize that cortisol regulates immune function during exposure to noise stressors in guppies.

Based on this hypothesis, I predict that fish exposed to acute noise stressors will have higher parasite loads due to a compromised immune system. However, when fish are exposed to a chronic noise stressor, fish will become habituated to the stressor, leading to lower cortisol levels and an immune system which is sufficient at combating parasites. 

JD: "sufficient" is awkward -- "better" might be cleanest here.

To test this hypothesis statistically, I would calculate the total parasite load for each treatment over all sampling days and run a one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences between treatments (control, acute and chronic noise stress). Using max parasite load (the highest number of parasites found on one sampling day) for each individual and calculating the average across treatments, I could compare them statistically the same way. If the data included cortisol levels collected for each fish, I would look at the relationship between treatment, cortisol levels and parasite load using a two-way ANOVA. 

JD: We should talk about the ANOVA choice. If your main question is acute vs. chronic, maybe that should be your main test as well

JD: This is very well done, but the MMV was very superficial. Grade: 1.8/3

If the MMV test gives a positive result:

      100% of the time for people with the virus
      5% of the time for people without the virus

And the population has a prevalence of 1%,

Then if a randomly selected person is tested and tests positive, the chances of them having MMV is 95%

If I learned that my friend has tested positive for MMV, I would tell them that there is a 5% chance that the result of the test was a false-positive, and in that case, they do not have MMV. However, the test is 95% accurate and there is therefore a 95% chance that they have MMV. 

JD: As I said, the point of the second question is how it might _differ_ from the first. In any case, your answers are not correct. What would happen if the a population had 10000 people and you tested _all_ of them? How many false/true positives and negatives would you have?
